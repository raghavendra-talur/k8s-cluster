== Issue 1:
Provider libvirt not found 
[source, bash]
----
$ vagrant up                                                                                                                                                                                                   
The provider 'libvirt' could not be found, but was requested to
back the machine 'master'. Please use a provider that exists.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Vagrant knows about the following providers: docker, hyperv, virtualbox
----

== Solution:
Make sure that we have ruby-dev or ruby-devel and then install libvirt plugin
[source, bash]
----
$ yum install ruby-devel
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt
$ vagrant plugin list 
vagrant-libvirt (0.0.45, global)
----

== Issue 2:
Invalid: sshfs
[source, bash]
----
$ vagrant up
Bringing machine 'master' up with 'libvirt' provider...
Bringing machine 'worker0' up with 'libvirt' provider...
Bringing machine 'worker1' up with 'libvirt' provider...
Bringing machine 'worker2' up with 'libvirt' provider...
==> worker2: Starting domain.
==> worker0: Starting domain.
==> worker1: Starting domain.

== Solution:
Vagrant attempting to use sshfs for the synced folder that is not a type of synced folder built into Vagrant. Install sshfs plugin
[source, bash]
----
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-sshfs
$ vagrant plugin list | grep sshfs
vagrant-sshfs (1.3.3, global)
